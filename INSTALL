=== Console ===

Before you try to compile QeoDart, make sure that you have installed the
Qt4 developer packages (libqt4-dev or the like), and the basic developer
tools for your operating system (e.g. build-essential [Ubuntu]).

cd QeoDart
qmake
make -j4
./QeoDart

=== Qt Creator ===

You can install Qt Creator using the package manager of your operating
system, or download it from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads.

Open the project file QeoDart.pro in Qt Creator and press Ctrl+R.
